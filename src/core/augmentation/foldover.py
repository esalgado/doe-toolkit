    Examples
    --------
    >>> # 2^(5-1) Resolution V design
    >>> design = generate_fractional_factorial(factors, '1/2', resolution=5)

    >>> # Add full foldover

    Notes
    -----
    Full foldover creates the "fold-over" design by changing all signs:
        x_new = -x_old
    
    The combined design is the union of original and foldover, which
    de-aliases effects according to standard foldover theory.

    - Uses same number of runs as original (more efficient than full foldover)
    - Does not fully increase resolution, but resolves specific confounding

    Notes
    -----
    Single-factor foldover is most useful when:
    1. One main effect is significant and aliased
    2. Budget limits prevent full foldover
    3. Only specific de-aliasing is needed
    
    The combined design (original + single-fold) allows estimation of:
    - The folded factor (clear of 2FI)
    - 2FI involving the folded factor
